# Level 4: Continuous Functions

Just as we moved from derivatives at a point to derivative functions, we can move from continuity at a point to continuity everywhere!

## From Point Continuity to Global Continuity

So far, `FunContAt f c` tells us that `f` is continuous at the specific point `c`.

But many functions (like polynomials) are continuous at *every* point.

## The New Definition

**Definition (`FunCont`):** We say that `f` is **continuous** (everywhere) if:

`∀ x, FunContAt f x`

This is written `FunCont f`.

In other words: `f` is continuous at every point in its domain.

## Why Polynomials Are Continuous

Intuitively, polynomials like `f(x) = x² - 1` are continuous because:
- You can draw them without lifting your pen
- Small changes in `x` produce small changes in `f(x)`
- There are no jumps, breaks, or asymptotes

We've worked with continuity of `x² - 1` before. Now we'll prove it's continuous **everywhere**!

## The Strategy

For any point `x`, we need to show `FunContAt (fun t ↦ t^2 - 1) x`.

This means: given `ε > 0`, find `δ > 0` such that `|t - x| < δ` implies `|f(t) - f(x)| < ε`.

The algebra follows a familiar pattern:

`f(t) - f(x) = (t² - 1) - (x² - 1) = t² - x² = (t - x)(t + x)`

So `|f(t) - f(x)| = |t - x| · |t + x|`.

If we restrict `|t - x| < 1`, then `|t + x| < |2x| + 1`.

Taking `δ = min(1, ε / (|2x| + 1))` will work!

## Your Challenge

Prove that `f(x) = x² - 1` is continuous everywhere:

`FunCont (fun x ↦ x^2 - 1)`

**Hint:** After introducing `x`, you need to bound `|t + x|` in terms of `x` (not a constant like `5`).

Use `min 1 (ε / (|2 * x| + 1))` as your `δ`. The key is showing that when `|t - x| < 1`, we have `|t + x| < |2 * x| + 1`.

Conclusion "
# Great Work!

You proved that `f(x) = x² - 1` is continuous at **every** point in ℝ. This means:
- The function has no jumps, breaks, or discontinuities anywhere
- Small changes in input always produce small changes in output
- You can trace the entire graph without lifting your pen

## The Technical Triumph

The key challenge was making your `δ` depend on the point `x` where you're proving continuity. Unlike derivatives where `δ = ε` worked universally, continuity required the more sophisticated choice:

`δ = min(1, ε / (|2x| + 1))`

This elegant formula ensures that:
- `|t - x| < 1` controls how far `t` can be from `x`
- The factor `|2x| + 1` accounts for how the function's \"sensitivity\" changes at different points
- The `min` operation balances both constraints perfectly

## From Specific to Universal

Notice the beautiful progression through all four levels:

1. **Level 1:** Sequential limits ↔ Function limits (foundational equivalence)
2. **Level 2:** Derivative at one point (local linear behavior)
3. **Level 3:** Derivatives everywhere (global differentiability)
4. **Level 4:** Continuity everywhere (global continuity)

You've built a complete picture of how polynomials behave!

## The Hierarchy of Smoothness

You've now established that `f(x) = x² - 1` is:
- **Continuous everywhere** (what you just proved)
- **Differentiable everywhere** (from Level 3)

This illustrates a fundamental hierarchy: differentiability implies continuity. Functions that have derivatives must be continuous, but continuous functions need not have derivatives everywhere.
